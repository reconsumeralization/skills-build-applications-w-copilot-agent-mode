# Mermaid Copilot: AI-Powered Executable Diagram Platform

![octofit-tracker-app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c45e716-1d95-473b-8923-dbbbf0f924b2)

_Build, visualize, and execute software architectures from diagrams using AI and Mermaid._

---

## What is Mermaid Copilot?

Mermaid Copilot is an enterprise-ready platform that turns Mermaid diagrams into interactive, executable software blueprints. Powered by AI, it bridges the gap between visual design and real code execution, enabling:

- **Diagram validation and live editing**
- **Clickable nodes with metadata and code execution**
- **Import/export of diagrams**
- **Custom node styling (colors, icons, badges)**
- **Pluggable execution environments (JS, Python, cloud, etc.)**
- **Real-time collaboration and sharing**

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Diagram Generation:** Use natural language to generate system diagrams with embedded metadata.
- **Executable Nodes:** Each node can represent a real service, function, or code block. Click to view metadata or execute code.
- **Live Validation:** Diagrams are checked for syntax and structure before rendering.
- **Import/Export:** Save and load `.mmd` files for reuse and sharing.
- **Custom Styling:** Style nodes with colors, icons, and badges via metadata.
- **Extensible Execution:** Plug in new execution engines (e.g., Python, cloud functions, microservices).
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Designed for teams, with collaboration and sharing in mind.

## Example Use Cases

- **Software Architecture Prototyping**
- **Workflow Automation**
- **Data Pipeline Visualization & Execution**
- **Education & Training**

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repo and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone ...
   cd mermaid-executable-app
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Edit diagrams in the UI, click nodes to execute, and export/import as needed.

## Roadmap

- [x] Diagram validation and rendering
- [x] Clickable, executable nodes
- [ ] Import/export diagrams
- [ ] Custom node styling
- [ ] Pluggable execution environments (Python, cloud, etc.)
- [ ] Real-time collaboration
