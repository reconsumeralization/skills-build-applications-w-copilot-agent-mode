# Mermaid Copilot App

This is the reference implementation of the Mermaid Copilot platformâ€”a next-generation, AI-powered, executable diagramming tool for software architecture, workflow automation, and more.

## Features

- **Live Mermaid diagram editing and validation**
- **Clickable, executable nodes** (see side panel for results)
- **Node metadata and code execution**
- **Import/export support (coming soon)**
- **Custom node styling (coming soon)**
- **Pluggable execution environments (coming soon)**

## How it Works

1. **Edit your diagram** in the main textarea.
2. **Click any node** in the rendered diagram to view its metadata and (if available) execute its code.
3. **See results** in the side panel.

## Development

- Run `npm install` in this directory.
- Start the app with `npm start`.
- Edit diagrams in `src/diagrams/` or via the UI.

## Roadmap

- [x] Diagram validation and rendering
